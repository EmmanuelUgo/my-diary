```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, tidy = "styler", out.width = '100%')
```

The [`{vroom}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/05/vroom-1-0-0/) package has been out for a while now and in this post, we will be comparing it to the [`{readr}`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. Both packages are used to load data in R. Today, we'll be looking at the time it takes `vroom()` from the `vroom` package to load data and comparing it to the `read_csv()` function from the `{readr}` package. The `{readr}` package is part of the [`{tidyverse}`](https://tidyverse.org/) ecosystem.

Who knows, you might learn something from my codes 🤪

### Loading Libraries

```{r}
library(vroom)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggimage)
library(ggtext)
library(showtext)


font_add_google(name = "quicksand",  family = "quicksand")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
paths <- "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Final JedCo Data/new_df.csv"
```

### Creating a tracking function

This function takes a single argument, path (location to the file on your PC) and records the time it took to load that file using the vroom() and read_csv() function and return a tibble of results with the size of the data.

```{r}
get_time_diff <- function(path){
  ## For Vroom
  start_vroom = Sys.time()
  
  vroom_data <- vroom(path, show_col_types = FALSE)
  
  end_vroom = Sys.time()
  
  result_vroom = end_vroom - start_vroom
  
  ## For readR
  start_readr = Sys.time()
  
  readr_data <- read_csv(path)
  
  end_readr = Sys.time()
  
  result_readr = end_readr - start_readr
  
  final_table = tribble(
    ~vroom , ~readr, ~size,
    ##########################
    result_vroom, result_readr, format(object.size(vroom_data), units = "Gb")
  )
  
  return(final_table)
}
```

```{r}
results <- get_time_diff(paths) %>%
  select(size,readr,vroom) %>% 
  mutate_at(c("readr","vroom"), as.numeric)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
results %>% 
  gt::gt(rownames_to_stub = TRUE) %>% 
  gt::fmt_number(columns = c(readr,vroom),
                 decimals = 2,
                 pattern = "{x} Sec")
  
```

### Visualization

```{r}
results <- results %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(vroom,readr))

sticker_pos <- tibble(x = c("vroom","readr"),
                      y = c(results$value[1] / 2, results$value[2] / 2),
                      sticker = c("vroom.png","readr.png"))

```

```{r}

ggplot() +
  geom_col(data = results, aes(name,value)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = results$value[2]/2, lty = 2) +
  geom_image(data = sticker_pos, aes(x,y,image = sticker), size = 0.15) +
  
  annotate(geom = "text", x = "vroom", y = (results$value[2]/2) + 2, label = "Half time mark for readr") +
  expand_limits(y = c(0, 50)) +
  labs(
    title = "**{vroom}** vs **{readr}**",
    subtitle = "Comparing the time it takes to load a data size of 1.4Gb",
    y = "Time (Sec)",
    x = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "quicksand"),
        plot.title = element_markdown())
  

```

### Conclusion

From the plot above, the `vroom` package did way better than the `readr` package, reading a 1.4Gb csv file far lower than half the time it took `readr` to load. The vroom package is an excellent way to load large data sizes in R.

Now you know a new and fast way to load data in R.
